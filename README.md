# Impact of students' behaviors on online learning platform to their GPA

### This is a part of the research in ITLab NEU
All of the files in this repo are done by me, and the sensitive data are eleminated. The data is collected from 4 credit classes in the School of Information Technology and Digital (SITDE) in National Economics University (NEU)

Those 4 classes are:
* "Yorao" : Java Programming
* "L71ar" : Web Design
* "ROmws" : Web Design
* "X0bmt" : Web Programming

This repo contains files that are required for:
* [Pulling data from Firebase](/get_the_perfect_class.ipynb)
* [Proving method of extracting and cleaning data](/Propose_on_changing_time.ipynb)
* [Main EDA file](/Core.ipynb)
* [Machine learning models](./ML3.ipynb)

Collecting scores and future analysis are done other members of Neucodelab 2 in ITLab. Thanks alot for your help.

### Background of the project
We are doing a research on the students' behaviour on online learning platform, its relationship with their scores, and how to use the tracked data to assist teachers in grading them.

The platform we choose is a website call "Vncodelab" (currently down), made by __Mr.Pham Xuan Lam__, guide of the ITLab NEU.
